1. You need to install Riff BOX driver for Blank Flash to work. Extract Riff BOX drivers in a folder (you will find both 32bit and 64bit versions). Open dseo13b.exe and choose "Sign a System File", follow the program instructions and there you go, the program will ask you to reboot. While you reboot press F8 multiple times until you get a menu, choose "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" and Windows will boot automatically after that. To enable, simply restart your system.
